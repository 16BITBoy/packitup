::Find a way to remove and avoid use of DATA objects for addressing local variables

The reason why I use DATA objects for addressing local variables is that when I need to use FDHANDLER to write int, long, char, float, or double values to a file I have to give to FDHANDLER::write() and FDHANDLER::append() functions a DATA object.

If I could find a good way to write these data types with FDHANDLER without passing a DATA object, I wouln't need DATA objects to know if the address they keep are local variables or dynamically allocated addresses.

One solution may be refactor save() and append() FDHANDLER functions in order to write polimorfic versions of them for each data type. Or I could use C++ templates.
